# Youtube Metadata

Wire source: `youtube_metadata`. Helper: `client.youtube.metadata`. Required input: `video_id`.
Modes: realtime, async, batch. [Product API reference](https://flashdata.dev/docs/sources/youtube_metadata).

## Runnable example

Run from the repository root after setting `FLASHDATA_API_KEY`:

```sh
python examples/youtube_metadata.py
```

```python
from flashdata import FlashData

with FlashData() as client:
    response = client.youtube.metadata('dQw4w9WgXcQ', include_formats=False, include_chapters=True)
    print(response)
```

## Parameters

The helper takes the main input and the following source options. Generic query methods
put options inside `params`. Omitted defaults are resolved by the API, not inserted by
the SDK. Request options select mode/callback separately from source parameters.

| Parameter | Type | Server/catalog default | Meaning / bounds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `include_formats` | boolean | true |  |
| `include_chapters` | boolean | true |  |

For `filters`, see the complete property definitions in [source-contract.json](../../source-contract.json).

## Response example

Illustrative provider fields; availability varies. The SDK preserves unknown fields.
